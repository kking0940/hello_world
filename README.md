Hi everyone!

I am attempting to learn about programing for my PhD dissertation in Psychology. Essentially, we are trying turn an exisiting neuro-psych assessment into an app so that we can easily use the test during at-home visits for the elderly. We want to use a touch screen because of the inherent issues with fine motor control that has been leading to false-negatives in patients who do too well (or too poorly) to get the assistance they need.
